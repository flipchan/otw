off the wire crypto, otr with pgp instead of diffie hellman, with other words: pgp with sha256hmac160

this is mostly a test script because i think that off the record crypto should have pgp instead of diffie hellman
i like pgp 4096rsa keys more then the default diffie hellman 1024 dsa key but thats just my opinion, 
feel free to use this freely as the license says use it and if u like it and if we meet u can buy me a beer
